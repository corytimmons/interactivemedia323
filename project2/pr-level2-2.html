	<span>the drone was once a scrap of metal     the drone looks as if it might be a toy     the drone is not a toy     the drone could have been something other than a killing machine     the drone could have been a house      the drone could have been a spoon     the drone could have been a swing     the drone does not know who it is going to kill next     the drone is going to kill next     the drone has learned to disguise itself as a shard of sky     the drone&#8217;s soft hum is a disembodied echo    the drone was mistaken for a star once     the drone renders itself celestial     the drone scoffs at sovereignty     the drone asks what is a border if you can fly right over it?     the drone was built by a man     the drone killed a man     & a woman     & a child     the drone killed a child     & did not see her face     the drone does not see a face     the drone sees a body     & then the body is gone.
