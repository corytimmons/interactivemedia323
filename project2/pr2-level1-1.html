	<p>the drone could have been a house</p>
	<p>the drone could have been a spoon</p>
	<p>the drone could have been a swing</p>
	<p>the drone does not know who it is going to kill next</p>
	<p>the drone is going to kill next</p>
	<p>the drone has learned to disguise itself as a shard of sky</p>
	<p>the drone&#8217;s soft hum is a disembodied echo</p>
	<p>the drone was mistaken for a star once</p>
	<p>the drone renders itself celestial</p>
	<p>the drone scoffs at sovereignty</p>
	<p>the drone asks what is a border if you can fly right over it?</p>
	<p>the drone was built by a man</p>
	<p>the drone killed a man</p>
	<p>& a woman</p>
	<p>& a child</p>
	<p>the drone killed a child</p>  
	<p>& did not see her face</p>    
	<p>the drone does not see a face</p>
